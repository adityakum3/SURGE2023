# SURGE2023
Here I add all the work that I did as part of the SURGE project under Professor Manindra Agrawal on Security analysis of Zerocoin and Developing the Smart Contract for File Sharing System

**FileManagementSystem.go** - This has a smart contract that enables users to send the file anonymously and securely. It is built on top of HyperLedger Fabric and works on top of Javascript SDKs.

It also has the posters and the report I made as part of my project.
